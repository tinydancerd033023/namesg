By https://github.com/Misaka-blog

## Project Features

* This project is used to deploy xray on any PaaS cloud service provider, and the solution adopted is Argo + Nginx + WebSocket + VMess/Vless/Trojan/Shadowsocks + TLS
* The xray core file and configuration file have been "specially processed", each project is different, which greatly reduces the risk of being blocked and sitting continuously
* The uuid of vmess and vless or the password of trojan and shadowsocks, the path can be customized or use the default value
* Integrated Nezha probe, you can freely choose whether to install it
* After the deployment is complete, if you find that you cannot access the Internet, please check whether the domain name is blocked. You can use the generated Argo node or Cloudflare CDN or worker to solve it.
